**Forage-MIDAS**

This repository contains my implementation of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage. The project is based on the MIDAS (Markets Insight Data Analytics System) platform, which simulates how traders analyze financial data streams and make better decisions.

During this simulation, I worked on debugging and fixing existing code, processing stock price data feeds, and creating visualization logic that could assist traders in decision-making. The tasks were designed to replicate real-world challenges faced by software engineers at JPMorgan Chase, giving me practical exposure to problem-solving in a financial technology context.

The project was completed using Java along with Git and VS Code. This experience allowed me to strengthen my programming and engineering knowledge while applying software development best practices in a simulated financial environment.

**##Skills Gained:**

Debugging and code optimization

Data handling and visualization

Version control using Git

Working with APIs and data feeds

Problem-solving and analytical thinking

Applying software development best practices in fintech

This experience allowed me to practice coding in a real-world financial context and gave me insights into how technology supports global markets.
